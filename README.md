This repository contains the problems for assignment 1.4 along with example problems and example solutions.
`problems-mini.xml` should be run on the small data set and `problems-big.xml` on the complete data set.

- [Mini data set](https://nc.kwarc.info/s/xgtdHcKRkHaKXfM)

#### `verify.py`
You can use `verify.py` to check your solutions for the example problems.
It will send them to a server and print out some feedback.
It requires the `requests` package (`python3 -m pip install requests`).
Then you can run the script with:
```
python3 verify.py mini path/to/your/example-solutions-mini.xml
python3 verify.py big path/to/your/example-solutions-big.xml
```
